# JavaFx Note App
This  is a simple Note App which displays the content of any Text file.
    
## Usage
* Simply click the `Open` Button and select the `File` from the Open file diague box.
* The Contents of the Text/Html File will be displayed in the `TextArea`
* To `Clear` the `TextArea` simply click on `Close` Button.
* To `Save` a file, click on `Save` or `Save As` Button.
* If you wish to edit text/html files, simply `Open` them, make changes, then click `Save`. The previous file will be overwritten.

## Plans
The Current plans are to make this into a program similar to `Notepad` and possibly to convert it into a Simple Text Editor like `Notepad++` which supports Syntax Highlighting.
